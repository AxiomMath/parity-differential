These files accompany the paper [arXiv:TODO](TODO).

The formal proofs provided in this work were developed and verified using **Lean 4.26.0**. Compatibility with earlier or later versions is not guaranteed due to the evolving nature of the Lean 4 compiler and its core libraries.

## Input files

- `task.md`: natural language description of the task to be completed
- `.environment`: specifies the Lean version

## Output files (Run with Lean 4.26.0)

- `problem.lean`: translation of the problem statement into formal language (Lean)
- `solution.lean`: solution in formal language (Lean)

## Miscellaneous files (not used or written by AxiomProver)

- `examples.py`: used to show example verification of small cases.
